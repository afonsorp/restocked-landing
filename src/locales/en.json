    "content": "We are Restocked.pt – the marketplace where obsolete stock becomes useful again to those who need it. For sellers, it's a way to generate sales from items that would likely not be considered revenue-generating. For buyers, it's a way to obtain products in good condition at equally competitive prices compared to the same items in today's market.\n\nAnother advantage is that we might have the part you can no longer find elsewhere – whether due to discontinued production or simply a temporary stockout. Either way, both scenarios make it possible to give visibility to items that wouldn't otherwise be on the market, creating advantageous opportunities for both sides: sellers and buyers.",

    "content": "Our commitment is to all sellers and customers. Our quality depends directly on the quality of the stock you wish to sell. Keep in mind that you could also be a buyer. The worst we can do is create expectations that won't be met.\n\nImagine finding a part on our platform, but upon receiving it, you realize it's damaged or physically defective. It's your reliability at stake—but ours as well.\n\nHelp us move your stock in a practical, cost-free, secure, and lasting way. We strive for high reliability. Please read our policy, which is part of the framework agreement you will sign with us."

  "howToPost": {
    "title": "How to Post Your Stock",
    "content": "All items must be uploaded to the shared file available on the website, after your registration has been validated by our team. Please note: all items must include an OEM reference. All items must be in their original form and condition, with no signs of use. In addition to the mandatory OEM reference, the item must be valued based on the purchase price at the time of its original acquisition. If multiple units are available, the number of units must be indicated."

    "title": "How It Works",

  "returnPolicy": {
    "title": "Return Policy",
    "content": "Any complaint from the end customer regarding the quality or defect of a part that is proven to be valid is entirely outside Restocked responsibility. The return shipping costs will be borne by the buyer, but the seller must fully refund the value of the item.\n\nRestocked margin will not be refunded and, in this situation, should be regarded as a 'penalty' for the failure in stock quality provided on the platform. In other words, the responsibility of listing valid stock increases and becomes penalizing for those who do not comply with this principle.\n\nThis is a best practice that is essential to us: do not share with others what you wouldn't want shared with you. Restocked golden rule, defending all interests!"

    "title": "What's In It For Us?",

    "subcontent": "We specialize in directing the listed stock to end customers who share their machinery inventory with us, allowing us to know exactly who might need each item. Additionally, the very companies that list their stock often find themselves in need of parts from others.\n\nCircularity. Opportunity. Savings. Profit. That's essentially who we are... and because we believe we do it well, we should earn some profit to keep this mission going and getting better and better. If we continuously improve, we will become a strong partner for all our clients. And that is the goal – for obsolete stock to end with us. With us, the concept of 'obsolete' comes to an end."
